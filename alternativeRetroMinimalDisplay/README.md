# Neon Minimalistic Dashboard

This dashboard is web-based and shows current data with a modern and digital look.
The data is obtained with asyncronus ajax calls to the php backend, which scans the csv files to fetch the latest results.

This must be used with the go downloader to be working up-to-date.
